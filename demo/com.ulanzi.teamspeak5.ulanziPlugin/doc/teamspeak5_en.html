    <h1>Setup Guide</h1>

    <h2>Connecting TeamSpeak</h2>
    <p>
      Launch TeamSpeak and head over to the <strong>Settings</strong> ->
      <strong>Remote Apps</strong>. Make sure that the Port is set to
      <strong>5899</strong>
    </p>
    <p>Now you should see a request sent by the Plugin, accept it.</p>

    <h2>Setting up Keybindings</h2>
    <p>
      After the connection is established, you need to bind each Ulanzi Deck
      Button to a TeamSpeak Keybinding.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>
        (Similar to what you do with a regular Key. The Plugin just sends
        virtual Keys)
      </i>
    </p>
    <p>
      So set up your Buttons on the Ulanzi Deck, select the corresponding
      function you want the Button mapped to.
    </p>
    <p>
      For example, you place the Mute Action on your Ulanzi Deck, then you need
      to select <strong>Choose</strong> on the Mute Binding in TeamSpeak and
      press the Button on the Ulanzi Deck. You need to repeat this for every
      other Key as TeamSpeak currently does not offer a way to setup the
      Bindings automatically!
    </p>
    <p>
      After setting all Keybindings, you are read to talk (or not if you are
      muted)!
    </p>

    <h2>Configuration of Whisperlists</h2>
    <p>Create a Whisperlist in TeamSpeak</p>
    <p>
      Place your Button on the Ulanzi Deck and input the name of the Whisperlist
      (This name does not need to match, but could interfere with other
      Whisperlist Buttons if two buttons are named the same)
    </p>
    <p>
      Click on <strong>Choose</strong> to set the Keybinding, then press the
      Button on the Ulanzi Deck and select the Whisperlist on the left side
      beside the Keybinding.
    </p>


    <p>Thanks for installing the Plugin </p>
